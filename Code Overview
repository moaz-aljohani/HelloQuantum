Section 1: Creating and Drawing the Circuit, initializes a quantum circuit with 2 qubits, applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and a CNOT gate to entangle the qubits.

Section 2: Measuring Observables, Defines various Pauli operators, uses an Estimator to measure the expectation values of these observables.

Section 3: Plotting Results, plots the expectation values of the observables using Matplotlib.

Section 4: Generalizing for N Qubits, defines a function to create a quantum circuit with any number of qubits, Applies a Hadamard gate to the first qubit and CNOT gates to entangle all qubits in a chain.
  
Section 5: Creating Sparse Pauli Operators, creates sparse Pauli operators for measurements on a circuit with multiple qubits.

Section 6: Running on IBM Quantum Backend, configures the quantum circuit to run on an IBM Quantum backend using the Qiskit Runtime service.
